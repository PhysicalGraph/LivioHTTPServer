/**
 * There are two ways to create your own custom WebSocket:
 *
 * - Subclass it and override the methods you're interested in.
 * - Use traditional delegate paradigm along with your own custom class.
 *
 * They both exist to allow for maximum flexibility.
 * In most cases it will be easier to subclass WebSocket.
 * However some circumstances may lead one to prefer standard delegate callbacks instead.
 * One such example, you're already subclassing another class, so subclassing WebSocket isn't an option.
